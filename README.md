# Freedom-Fighter
Freedom Fighter is a browser-based shooting game created for my Web Development final project. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features animated sprites, sound effects, a scoring system, and responsive gameplay. Players shoot spy birds to protect Croux-Town and earn points.
